Two important sub-themes form an integral part of Frictionless Enterprise<!--more-->: 

+ Collaborative canvas, a framework for organizing the technology and culture of effective digital teamwork across the enterprise. 
+ XaaS (pronounce 'X-ass'), an acronym for Everything-as-a-Service. XaaS is the underlying business model of Frictionless Enterprise. 

Here are some articles where you can start reading about these core themes and how they fit together:

When I have time, I'll add some additional posts to link to some of the thinking behind these core concepts, but you'll find the above articles already include quite a few links to other reading.
