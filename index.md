# What is Frictionless Enterprise?

We live in a connected world. Telecoms, air travel and more than anything else the WorldWide Web of information and cloud computing have collapsed distance and supercharged teamwork in ways that were unimaginable just a decade or two ago.

These changes have removed much of the friction that used to add cost and inconvenience to many business interactions. The classic theory of the firm stated that an enterprise could only be efficient by bringing as many operations as possible in-house. Today, the reverse has become true. The leanest, most agile and cost-efficient enterprises are those that use the global reach and immediacy of the cloud to access resources on demand.

We are entering the era of frictionless enterprise: an era when new ways of working, new ways of interacting and new forms of organization will emerge to completely transform the way individuals and businesses operate and succeed.
